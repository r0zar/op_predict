# Refactoring Summary: Server Actions to Library

## Overview of Changes

We've successfully refactored critical business logic from server actions into the library to ensure consistent behavior between server actions and MCP tools. The following high-priority refactorings were completed:

### 1. Market Resolution Logic (`market-store.ts`)

- Added `resolveMarketWithPayouts(marketId, winningOutcomeId, adminId)` function that handles:
  - Market status updates
  - Payout calculations with admin fee (5%)
  - Balance updates for winners
  - User stats updates for leaderboard
  - Prediction status updates

### 2. Prediction Creation Logic (`prediction-store.ts`)

- Added `createPredictionWithBalanceUpdate(data)` function that handles:
  - Balance validation and deduction
  - Market and outcome verification
  - Prediction creation with NFT receipt
  - Market stats updates

### 3. Prediction Redemption Logic (`prediction-store.ts`)

- Added `validateRedemptionEligibility(predictionId, userId)` to verify:
  - Prediction ownership
  - Redemption eligibility (won/lost status)
  - If prediction is already redeemed
  
- Added `redeemPredictionWithBalanceUpdate(predictionId, userId)` that handles:
  - Eligibility validation
  - Balance updates with payout
  - Prediction status updates

### 4. Bug Report Reward Logic (`bug-report-store.ts`)

- Added `processRewardPayment(reportId, userId, rewardType, customAmount)` that handles:
  - Initial and confirmation rewards
  - Balance updates
  - Reward status tracking
  - Status transitions for resolution

## Impact on MCP Tools

For MCP tools to properly leverage these refactored functions, the following updates are needed:

### Market Tools:

- **mcp__predict__update_market** should use `resolveMarketWithPayouts` when resolving a market to ensure proper payout calculation and balance updates
- This will require passing the admin user ID for proper admin fee attribution

### Prediction Tools:

- **mcp__predict__create_prediction** should use `createPredictionWithBalanceUpdate` instead of making direct calls to ensure proper market validation and balance updates
- **mcp__predict__process_bug_report_reward** should use `bugReportStore.processRewardPayment` to properly handle reward attribution

### Redemption Tools:

- Any functions dealing with prediction redemption should use `redeemPredictionWithBalanceUpdate` to ensure proper balance updates and eligibility checking

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Consistency**: Both server actions and MCP tools now have access to the same business logic
2. **DRY Principle**: Business logic is not duplicated between server actions and MCP tools
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to business rules only need to be made in one place
4. **Security**: Authorization and validation logic is centralized

## Next Steps

1. Update the MCP tools to use these new library functions
2. Add comprehensive tests for the new library functions
3. Consider refactoring additional server actions (medium-priority items)
4. Add input validation using Zod at the library level for consistent validation
