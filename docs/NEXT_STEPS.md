   - Consider removing the old lib/src directory

2. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Continue testing integration with wisdom-mcp server
   - Verify resource endpoints functionality
   - Test subscription behavior for real-time updates
   - Address any connection issues or API incompatibilities

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create comprehensive API usage documentation
   - Update architecture diagrams to reflect new dependencies
   - Document resource URI scheme for future references
   - Add examples of connecting to the MCP server

## Short-term Goals (2-3 Weeks)

1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Enhance prediction creation interface
   - Improve market card visualization
   - Add better onboarding for new users
   - Implement more intuitive market navigation

2. **Performance Optimization**
