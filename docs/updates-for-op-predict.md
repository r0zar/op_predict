# Signet Extension: OP_PREDICT Updates

## Overview

We've implemented several key improvements to the Signet Chrome extension to better support the OP_PREDICT platform, focusing on the three highest-priority items from the wishlist:

1. **Enhanced Response Messages** with detailed transaction data
2. **Rich Notifications** with embedded media and interactive elements
3. **Enhanced Wallet Updates** with change tracking

These improvements significantly upgrade the dapp integration capabilities of Signet, making it more powerful and informative for users.

## 1. Enhanced Response Messages

We've implemented structured response messages that provide detailed information after user actions:

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Response Data**: Transaction hashes, signatures, receipt IDs, and detailed metadata
- **Market-Specific Information**: Market IDs, names, outcome details, odds, and potential payouts
- **Fee Transparency**: Clear breakdown of platform fees and network fees
- **Structured Rejection Reasons**: Specific rejection codes, messages, and details for handling different rejection types

### Example Approval Response

```json
{
  "type": "NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE",
  "id": "predict-1717181920",
  "notificationType": "OP_PREDICT",
  "approved": true,
  "timestamp": 1717181920000,
  "result": {
    "transactionHash": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
    "signature": "0xabc123...",
    "receiptId": "receipt-9876543210",
    "metadata": {
      "marketId": "market-123",
      "marketName": "Will BTC reach $100k in 2024?",
      "outcomeId": 1,
      "outcomeName": "Yes",
      "amount": 50,
      "odds": 3.5,
      "potentialPayout": 175,
      "feeAmount": 2.5,
      "networkFee": 0.001
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Rejection Response

```json
{
  "type": "NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE",
  "id": "predict-1717181920",
  "notificationType": "OP_PREDICT",
  "approved": false,
  "timestamp": 1717181920000,
  "rejectionReason": {
    "code": "USER_REJECTED",
    "message": "User canceled the prediction",
    "details": "User felt the odds were not favorable"
  }
}
```

## 2. Rich Notifications

We've enhanced notifications with support for rich media and interactive elements:

### Key Features

- **Embedded Images**: Support for displaying images within notifications
- **HTML Content**: Rich HTML-formatted notification content for better information display
- **Custom Action Buttons**: Configurable interactive buttons beyond the standard approve/reject options
- **Visual Styling**: Enhanced styling options for different notification types

### Example Rich Notification Request

```javascript
window.postMessage({
  type: 'SHOW_NOTIFICATION',
  title: 'NFT PURCHASE SUCCESSFUL',
  message: 'You have successfully purchased an NFT',
  notificationType: 'OP_TRANSFER',
  // Rich content features
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/nft-image.jpg',
  htmlContent: `
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span style="color: #50fa7b; font-weight: bold;">Transaction successful!</span>
      <p>Your new NFT is now in your wallet.</p>
      <div style="font-size: 10px; color: #bd93f9;">
        Transaction hash: 0x71c...9e3f
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  // Custom action buttons
  actions: [
    {
      id: 'view-nft',
      label: 'VIEW NFT',
      action: 'approve',
      color: 'rgb(125, 249, 255)'
    },
    {
      id: 'dismiss',
      label: 'DISMISS',
      action: 'dismiss'
    }
  ]
}, '*');
```

## 3. Enhanced Wallet Updates

We've implemented detailed wallet update messages with context about balance changes:

### Key Features

- **Change Tracking**: Previous balance, current balance, and delta values
- **Change Context**: Reasons for balance changes (wins, losses, deposits, etc.)
- **Related Transaction Data**: Linked transaction details with IDs, timestamps, and market information
- **Visual Notifications**: Automatic notifications for significant wallet balance changes

### Example Wallet Update Message

```json
{
  "type": "WALLET_UPDATE",
  "address": "sp1abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  "balance": "1240.50",
  "previousBalance": "1200.50",
  "delta": "+40.00",
  "reason": "PREDICTION_WIN",
  "relatedTransaction": {
    "id": "tx-987654321",
    "type": "MARKET_RESOLUTION",
    "timestamp": 1717181920000,
    "marketId": "market-456",
    "marketName": "Will ETH merge in August 2024?"
  }
}
```
